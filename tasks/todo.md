# ticker-sentinel: workstream state

## Pen registry (serialized shared state)
- `data/cache/` (committed parquet fundamentals cache AND `run_history.json`,
  the cross-run change-detection state added in Phase 4): pen held by the
  **scheduled GitHub Actions job**, which commits `cache: refresh fundamentals`
  straight to main after scheduled runs (the existing `git add data/cache` step
  picks up both). Workstream branches must not modify `data/cache/` contents;
  expect to rebase over bot commits before merging. Local real runs write
  `run_history.json`; discard that change rather than committing it.

## Active workstreams
- (none). One branch per workstream via `scripts/new-worktree.sh <branch>`;
  main is the review inbox; merge back via PR.

## Done
- `variety-deterioration` (2026-08-06, merged as PR #1, worktree torn down):
  Phase 4 shipped: run-history state file, What-changed and Deterioration-watch
  sections, watchlist 8 -> 20 (CYBR/CFLT swapped for FTNT/ESTC after
  delisting), Twelve Data pacing. Spec/plan: SPEC.md + tasks/plan.md. Note: PR
  checks were absent due to the 2026-08-06 GitHub Actions outage; local bar was
  green with the same script.

## Next gates (owner)
- First scheduled run after merge creates `data/cache/run_history.json`; change
  detection starts the morning after (first email says "no prior state").
- Weekly watchlist candidate refresh (owner-initiated, first one ~2026-08-13);
  bench: WDAY, SHOP, TWLO, ZM.
